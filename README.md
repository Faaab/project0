Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a web page I made in order to practice my HTML skills. It is utter nonsense, and I advise you to spend your time on more interesting things.

Features:
* text!
* headers!
* a list!
* an image!
* several links!
* an embedded youtube video!
* several colors!
* SASS styling!
* 1000+ hours of open-ended sandbox soulslike gameplay!
