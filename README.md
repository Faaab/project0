Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I wanted to learn the basics of web development, but I did not know what to write. At first I thought to just fill my page with lorem ipsum, but in the end I decided to write some nonsense about lorem ipsum fron the lorem ipsum wikipedia page.

Features:
* tekst!
* headers!
* a list!
* an image!
* several links!
* an embedded youtube video!
* several colors!
* SASS styling!
* 1000+ hours of open-ended sandbox soulslike gameplay!
