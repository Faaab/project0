        <h1>Salve, orbis terrarum!</h1>

        <p>Normally when you make a website and have nothing to write, you just copy/pase some lorem ipsum to fill the page. But where does lorem ipsum come from? This is what Wikipedia has to say about it.</p>

        <p class="retracted">It's all a direct quote from Wikipedia. Sue me. (Just kidding, please don't sue me.)</p>

        <div id="wiki-quote">

            <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing" title="Publishing">publishing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a>, <span class="important-word">lorem ipsum</span> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_text" class="mw-redirect" title="Placeholder text">placeholder text</a> commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without relying on meaningful content (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeking" title="Greeking">greeking</a>). Replacing the actual content with placeholder text allows designers to design the form of the content before the content itself has been produced.</p>

            <p>The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_finibus_bonorum_et_malorum" title="De finibus bonorum et malorum"><span lang="Burmese" dir="rtl">De finibus bonorum et malorum</span></a></i>, a 1st-century BC Latin text by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero" title="Cicero">Cicero</a>, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>.</p>

            <p>A variation of the ordinary lorem ipsum text has been used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting" title="Typesetting">typesetting</a> since the 1960s or earlier, when it was popularized by advertisements for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letraset" title="Letraset">Letraset</a> transfer sheets. It was introduced to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age" title="Information Age">Information Age</a> in the mid-1980s by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus" title="Aldus">Aldus Corporation</a>, which employed it in graphics and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker" title="Adobe PageMaker">PageMaker</a>.</p>
